# RNSkia Expo Example

For developers who want to try RNSkia quickly using Expo Go, without building native code.

Expo is awesome. It enables developers to experiment with React Native quickly and easily.
I couldn't find a runnable RNSkia example for Expo, so I made one.

## Usage

```sh
make init
make run
```
